      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Frank Metcalf and I am 22 years old. I grew up in a
        western suburb of Chicago, Western Springs. I am the youngest of three
        siblings. I grew up with two older brothers, Anthony and Philip (28 &
        26), my mom Cindy and my dad Phil.

        Currently, I am senior at the University of Iowa studying Finance &
        Business Analytics and Information Systems. At Iowa, I am tour guide
        where I give 90 minute tours to perspective students and families around
        campus and field any questions and concerns they may have. I am also
        apart of Moneythink. In this club I go to surrounding Iowa City high
        schools and teach basic finance concepts (what a credit card is, how to
        buy a car, savings vs checking accounts). I also am fan of intramurals,
        joining pickleball, sand volleyball and basketball.
      </p>

        I will graduate from Iowa in May 2025. After graduation I will return to
        Chicago and in August start working as a Credit Analyst at the Bank of
        Montreal. I am excited to put to use both my finance and business
        analytics skills that I have learned and curated at Iowa.
      </p>

        For fun, I love to travel. I just recently returned from Punta Cana and
        my second semester sophmore year I studied abroad in Italy and traveled
        to 10 different countries (see full list below). This summer I will be
        retruning back to Europe to visit Denmark, France, Monaco and Italy. I
        also enjoy watching movies, listening to music (specifically country,
        pop and oldies) and going to the gym.
