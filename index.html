          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello! My name is Frank Metcalf and I am
            <span class="italic bold">22</span> years old. I grew up in a western
            suburb of Chicago, Western Springs. I am the youngest of three siblings.
            I grew up with two older brothers, Anthony and Philip (<span
              class="italic bold"
              >28</span
            >
            & <span class="italic bold">26</span>), my mom Cindy and my dad Phil.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I am senior at the University of Iowa studying Finance &
            Business Analytics and Information Systems. At Iowa, I am tour guide
            where I give 90 minute tours to perspective students and families around
            campus and field any questions and concerns they may have. I am also
            apart of Moneythink. In this club I go to surrounding Iowa City high
            schools and teach basic finance concepts (what a credit card is, how to
            buy a car, savings vs checking accounts). I also am fan of intramurals,
            joining pickleball, sand volleyball and basketball.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will graduate from Iowa in <span class="underline">May 2025</span>.
            After graduation I will return to Chicago and in August start working as
            a <span class="bold">Credit Analyst</span> at the
            <span class="bold">Bank of Montreal</span> I am excited to put to use
            both my finance and business analytics skills that I have learned and
            curated at Iowa.
          </p>
          <p>
            For fun, I love to travel. I just recently returned from Punta Cana and
            my second semester sophmore year I studied abroad in Italy and traveled
            to <span class="italic bold">10</span> different countries (see full
            list below). This summer I will be retruning back to Europe to visit
            Denmark, France, Monaco and Italy. I also enjoy watching movies,
            listening to music (specifically country, pop and oldies) and going to
            the gym.
